# quizzler
One of many projects completed for 100 Days of Code!!
This quizzler app has a GUI and asks you ten true/false questions. 
Some cool features:
  -The screen lights up green when you are correct and red when incorrect.
  -Every time you restart the game you get ten new questions, so it will not repeat. 
    This app utilizes an online API to generate questions and answers.
  -I can adapt the code so that you can play a specific category.
